          <p>The healthcare system is facing an unprecedented crisis, but accurate COVID-19 coding and billing can help
            providers weather the storm and prepare for future outbreaks.</p>
          <hr>
          <img class="rounded " alt="Coding students " style="height:auto; max-width:100%; border:none;

          <br>
          <p><time datetime="2020-4-17">April 17, 2020</time> -&nbsp;The COVID-19 pandemic is putting strain on the
            healthcare system, but accurately capturing data and documenting cases of the novel coronavirus can help
            ease the burden on providers.</p>

          <p>COVID-19 coding and billing allows providers to track the spread of the novel coronavirus and get paid for
            testing and treating the sudden surge of patients presenting with symptoms of the highly contagious disease.
            And effective processes will help providers overcome the challenges of COVID-19 now and in the future.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;Equipping a health care workforce to accurately code medical procedures, streamlines communication
            across the health system, reducing administrative and rework costs at a time when resources are stretched by
            the COVID-19 pandemic,&rdquo; says Patrice A. Harris, MD, MA, president of the American Medical Association
            (AMA).</p>

          <p>However, a lack of resources and oftentimes know-how is preventing many providers from realizing the
            benefits of effective COVID-19 coding and billing.</p>
        </div>
        <p>It is not business as usual at this time. Many healthcare organizations have had to cancel or postpone their
          normal services to prevent the spread of COVID-19, while many more are now treating and having to document
          patients with a completely novel condition. Meanwhile, increasing unemployment rates are bringing in a new mix
          of patients to organizations, creating more coding and documentation challenges than usual.</p>

        <p>The healthcare industry is quickly adapting to world in which COVID-19 exists and that includes creating new
          codes for the novel coronavirus. Using these codes and new documentation guidelines that come with them will
          be critical to tackling COVID-19 and the challenges associated with it.</p>

        <p>In the following article, <em>RevCycleIntelligence </em>breaks down what providers need to know about
          COVID-19 coding and billing and best practices organizations can implement to ease the burden now and when the
          dust settles.</p>

        <h3><strong>New codes enable COVID-19 tracking and billing</strong></h3>

        <p>Providers use a variety of medical code sets to document and bill for patient encounters. The primary sets
          used by providers have all recently created new codes to capture COVID-19 testing and care.</p>

        <h3><strong><em>ICD-10-CM</em></strong></h3>

        <p>Spurred by the urgent need to capture COVID-19 diagnoses on claims and surveillance data, the CDC announced
          in March that is has added the new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical
          Modification (ICD-10-CM) emergency code created by the World Health Organization earlier this year. The code
          to document the diagnosis of COVID-19 is U07.1, 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease.</p>
        .</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/icd/COVID-19-guidelines-final.pdf">official guidance</a>
          from the CDC, providers should only use U07.1 to document a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 as documented by
          the provider, per documentation of a positive COVID-19 test result, or a presumptive positive COVID-19 test
          result. This also applies to asymptomatic patients who test positive for coronavirus.</p>

        <p>CDC notes that this is an exception to the hospital inpatient guideline. In this case,
          &ldquo;confirmation&rdquo; does not require documentation of the type of test performed, rather provider
          documentation is sufficient.</p>

        <p>The new ICD-10-CM code is a principal or first-listed diagnosis code, so providers should sequence it first
          then use appropriate codes for associated manifestations, except in obstetric patients.</p>

        <p>CMS has also <a
            href="https://edit.cms.gov/files/document/icd-10-ms-drgs-version-371-r1-effective-april-1-2020-updated-march-23-2020.pdf">recognized</a>
          the code for Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) Grouper purposes effective April 1, 2020 at
          which time the ICD-10 MS-DRG Grouper software package accommodated the new code.</p>
        <p>
        <p>Suspected, possible, probable, or inconclusive cases of COVID-19 should not be assigned U07.1, CDC emphasizes
          in the guidance. Instead, providers should assign codes explaining the reason for the encounter, such as a
          fever or Z20.828, Contact with and (suspected) exposure to other viral communicable diseases.</p>

        <p>Providers should also code for exposure to COVID-19 using code Z03.818, Encounter for observation for
          suspected exposure to other biological agents ruled out and screening, CDC states.</p>

        <h3><strong><em>CPT</em></strong></h3>

        <p>Since the COVID-19 outbreak, AMA has also been updating its Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code set to
          enable providers to code and bill for coronavirus testing.</p>

        <p>AMA <a
            href="https://revcycleintelligence.com/news/ama-unveils-new-cpt-code-for-coronavirus-test">announced</a> on
          March 13 the addition of CPT code 87635 for novel coronavirus testing through infectious agent detection by
          nucleic acid. The code should be used, for example, if a provider or other healthcare professional collects
          respiratory swabs and sends them to the lab after suspecting a 47-year-old male presenting to the emergency
          department with fever, cough, and shortness of breath has COVID-19.</p>

        <p>More recently, the association unveiled the addition of codes 86328 and 86769 for COVID-19 antibody tests and
          the revision for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests (86318).</p>

        <p>Code 86328 was created for antibody tests using a single step method immunoassay, AMA stated in the
          announcement. The testing method usually includes a strip with all of the critical components for the assay
          and is appropriate for a point-of care platform. Code 86769 was established for antibody tests using a
          multiple step method, the association reported.</p>

        <h3><em><strong>HCPCS</strong></em></h3>

        <p>As COVID-19 testing ramps up, CMS has created Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes so
          providers can get reimbursed for diagnosing patients and stopping the spread of coronavirus.</p>

        <p>Earlier this year, CMS announced the addition of two codes &ndash; U0001 and U0002 &ndash; for COVID-19
          tests. The first code can be used to document and bill for tests performed specifically at CDC testing
          laboratories, while the second code supports the agency&rsquo;s efforts to allow clinical laboratories outside
          of the CDC to create and bill for their own COVID-19 tests.</p>

        <p>Medicare started accepting the codes on April 1, 2020, and the codes will be retroactive to account for
          testing done on or after Feb. 4, 2020.</p>

        <p>According to a pricing list from March 12, 2020, Medicare will reimburse providers about $35 for claims coded
          with U0001 and approximately $51 for claims with U0002.</p>

        <h3><strong>Telehealth coding and billing</strong></h3>

        <p>In addition to caring for patients with a novel virus, many providers are also engaging in unchartered
          territory: telehealth.</p>

        <p>Hospitals are using telehealth services when possible to triage patients, a recent report from the Office of
          the Inspector at HHS showed. Ambulatory organizations are following suit as elective and non-urgent services
          decline .</p>

        <p>But for many providers, telehealth is a new service emerging from the COVID-19 crisis and it is presenting
          new coding and billing challenges for organizations.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, HHS has relaxed a wide range of rules and regulations to enable providers to leverage telehealth
          during the crisis and get paid the same amount for treating patients virtually. Some of the services include
          telehealth visits, virtual check-ins, and e-visits. The department also continues to add new services to the
          list as the crisis continues.</p>

        <p>To document telehealth services and other virtual visits, CMS has provided a <a
            href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/Telehealth/Telehealth-Codes">list of HCPCS
            codes</a> that will be paid for under the Physician Fee Schedule during the national emergency.</p>

        <p>AMA has also >provided guidance on telehealth coding and billing using CPT codes. The guidance covers coding
          for telehealth visits, online digital visits, remote patient monitoring, and telephone evaluation and
          management services. The association&rsquo;s 11 scenarios for CPT coding during the crisis also includes
          examples of how to code for telehealth services.</p>

        <h3><strong>Best practices for COVID-19 coding and billing</strong></h3>

        <p>Rules and regulations are seemingly changing every day as new information emerges regarding COVID-19, and
          with that coding and billing policies shift to account for the latest information. With that in mind,
          providers need to be diligently following coding and billing guidance from the CDC, CMS, AMA, and other
          official organizations, says Maria Noelle Ward, MEd, RHIA, CCS, CCS-P, director of HIM practice excellence at
          AHIMA.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Most importantly, they need to be sure that they&#39;re following the coding guidelines, those
          provided from a visit perspective and the telehealth and the CPT codes, but also the guidelines that have been
          provided by the CDC for actually coding patients who have COVID,&rdquo; she told
          <em>RevCycleIntelligence</em>.</p>

        <p>This is especially important as hospitals shift services to outpatient in preparation for greater inpatient
          demand, Ward stressed.</p>

        <p>Providers should also be assessing documentation guidelines in their EHRs to make sure providers are
          accurately documenting services at this time. CDI query templates are a key resource for providers, Ward
          stated.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;All of the coded data is going to provide information that contributes to patient care, public policy,
          reimbursement determination, and any of the statistics related to the spread of COVID,&rdquo; Ward concluded.
          &ldquo;Researchers looking at how to treat this and future coronavirus outbreaks are going to need this
          information. So, it has to be correct on the front end.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;In order to do that, we have to have complete, precise, accurate documentation and it needs to reflect
          all of the related conditions. That&rsquo;s going to lead to higher quality data that will affect patient
          outcomes in the future.&rdquo;</p>
